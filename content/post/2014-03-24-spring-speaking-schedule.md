Spring is in there air (well, intermittently here in the Pacific Norhwest), and that means - the spring conference season is shaping up. With three kids at home who are all 6 years old and under, I'm still trying to keep my travel under control. However, I will be venturing out a bit, so here's where I'll be over the next couple of months. If you're in the area, I would love to catch up - so let me know!
