In response to my recent post on Swagger and REST, I was asked the following on Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/howard_dierking">@howard_dierking</a> Trying to dig deeper into the philosophy of API specs. Got recommended reading beyond your links?</p>&mdash; Aram Zucker-Scharff (@Chronotope) <a href="https://twitter.com/Chronotope/status/785633342121086976">October 11, 2016</a></blockquote>

Rather than a Twitter stream of references, I thought I would just consolidate my resource list here. Note that for the most part, this list is limited to books. While I've put a few canonical Web documents on here, it's nearly impossible to go back through and chronicle every blog post and article that has shaped my thinking.

Finally, a shameless plug to the [repository where I've been testing out many of these ideas](https://github.com/howarddierking/building-restful-services) in the form of a reference application. This repository was originally intended to support a related [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) course, but as my own journey continues to take different turns, I've put the course on hold until I'm 100% confident in any recommendations that I make.
