Before we get too far into it, I wanted to quickly let you know that towards the end of last year, my longtime friend and product leader, [Glenn Block](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gblock/) and I started a new podcast called ["Until the Ice Cream Truck"](https://untiltheicecreamtruck.com/). If you're wondering what in the world that crazy name is all about, please allow me to tease [episode 1](https://untiltheicecreamtruck.com/introductions) where we get into those details. However, the big idea for the podcast is simply this: Glenn and I want to explore common issues in the tech space through our respective lenses in product (Glenn) and engineering (me). We're through episode 6 at this point and have hit on everything from [layoffs](https://untiltheicecreamtruck.com/leading-through-layoffs) to [technical debt](https://untiltheicecreamtruck.com/on-technical-debt) - and there's still so much ground left to cover. If you're at all interested, I hope that you'll take a listen and let us know what you think. The podcast is available through all the regular channels!
