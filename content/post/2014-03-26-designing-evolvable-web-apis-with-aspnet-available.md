Although it actually became available last week, I hadn't blogged about it yet, so correcting that oversight here...

After over a year of development, what started as an abstract idea has finally come into being. The idea, while abstarct, was not simple by any means - we wanted to write a book that covered not just the internal workings of the ASP.NET Web API framework, but also how to use it to build systems that would be reliable and evolvable over a long period of time.

Many thanks to everyone involved, from co-authors, to all of the good folks at [O'Reilly](http://oreilly.com) for making this happen!
