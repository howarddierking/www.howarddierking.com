Every now and then, somebody will ask me what I'm currently reading or researching. As such, I want to provide my current reading list along with the top items on my backlog. I'll also try to publish these posts more frequently so that you [and I] can track progress as well as see what topics and resources have sneaked in.

## Currently Reading

* [Terraform: Up & Running](https://www.terraformupandrunning.com/) - We use Terraform at work for all of our provisioning and configuration automation, so it's important to me that I understand what I'm looking at.
* [The Contrary Farmer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001F0PYO6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) - Hey, follow the whole person, right? :)
* [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) - Sometimes you need to go back to the beginning to get a fresh perspective on current problems.


## Backlog

* [The world beyond batch: Streaming 102](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-102) - Follow up article to a really great [part one](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-101)
* [Streaming Architecture](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049463.do) - A hopefully thorough treatment of the topics introduced in the preceding article.
* [JavaScript Allong√©, the "Six" Edition](https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix/read) - Applicative programming in Javascript - plus a bunch of other good things.
* [Haskell Programming From First Principles](https://gumroad.com/d/e76dd1c96380785b1845121c8ada5908) - I'm a glutton for punishment?
* [Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist](https://www.amazon.com/Semantic-Web-Working-Ontologist-Effective/dp/0123735564) - I've read about half of this book in the past and got pulled away. I think part of my problem in the past was an improper understanding of linked data: I was looking at linked data as a bunch of techniques to produce better RESTful APIs. I've since come to the belief that RESTful APIs are a rather uninteresting characteristic of a linked data application - and there's a *lot* more that linked data has to offer.
* [Learning SPARQL](http://www.learningsparql.com/) - An essential tool if you want to have a practical understanding of linked data.

## Journals

* [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/) - These days, HBR is pretty much the only periodical that I keep up with, and I appreciate the insights that I continue finding within its pages.

That's all I'm going to list here since, as I'm sure you all know, planning too far into the future virtually guarantees an unmet plan. Let me know what's on your reading list in the comments!
